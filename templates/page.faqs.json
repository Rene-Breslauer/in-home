If the intent is to just install a functional golf simulator, then a room size of 10 ft. tall, 15 ft. wide and 20 ft. deep would suit your needs. In instances where you want to create a holistic experience for friends and family, then 25 ft. long is ideal.

Regardless of what footwear you decide on (we advise against heels), the key to maintaining a sharp looking, high performance simulator is cleanliness. Well used golf shoes often come with bits of soil, sand and grass that can migrate to the strike pad. This increases the odds of those loose materials being sent at your impact screen at high speed, resulting in an unwanted mark.<\/p>","page-content":"","default-open":false}},"c5e535ac-a60d-4200-a851-5412a38d0423":{"type":"collapsible-row","settings":{"heading":"How accurate are golf simulators for distance?","description":"<p>Each tracking system and launch monitor has its own method for measuring and calculating critical parameters like club speed, ball speed, face angle, loft, spin etc. All of these measurements go into the algorithms for carry and total distance, but not all systems are created equal!

Finally, the data is outputted from your PC through a projector so you can see it all happen on the screen.
